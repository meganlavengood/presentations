## Inspiration

Legendary timbre scholar Cornelia Fales wrote a book chapter in 2018 that used the archives of a listserv to perform digital ethnography on a group of 1990s ravers.

`CLICK` Her article discusses a connection between the fringe status of EDM (at the time at least) and its "nonspecificity." She documents that these EDM listeners prioritized nonspecificity in their timbres by preferring timbres with ambiguous or disconnected sound sources, and rejecting vocals with meaningful lyrics as distracting and disruptive.

Citing perception studies, Fales argues that the musical features of EDM actually promote and support timbral attentiveness. This is important for pedagogues of timbre: by de-emphasizing more familiar domains of focus, we can more easily get students to pay attention to timbre. `CLICK`

As a bonus, it turns out that according to Fales's research, listening in this way can improve one's appreciation for EDM. It's true that much EDM lacks vocals, easily-identifiable instruments, and some music theory comfort objects like teleological progressions. This can make EDM seem hard to understand, but if we learn to hear in this new timbre-focused way, we would be hearing more like the EDM community would. `CLICK`

## Timbre in EDM Learning Module

Fales's chapter inspired me to come up with this module dedicated to learning about timbre and texture through EDM. I've broken it into four lessons, which you can see enumerated here.

-- `[CLICK]`

These are conceived as 75-minute lessons, since that's how long my classes are at George Mason. They are accessible for non-majors, since timbre and texture don't depend on music notation or an understanding of tonality. But they would be just at home in a core theory class. I would teach this in my pop and jazz class for undergraduate music majors, but again, since it doesn't require understanding notation or tonality, it can fit anywhere in your curriculum.

-- `[CLICK]`

So to explain my reasoning behind this sequencing:

`CLICK` First: texture in pop music. We’re gonna start with texture because it’s very concrete. It’s very easy to pick up on and it’s simpler to describe. I find that a lot of students already have a good intuitive understanding of texture in pop music just from their experience listening to it throughout their lives.

`CLICK` Then, talking about texture leads naturally into talking about timbre, especially if we're going to analyze texture in EDM. Since EDM uses a lot of sounds that don’t have a clear sound source, it becomes meaningless to talk about instruments, and instead we need to talk more precisely about timbral effects.

`CLICK` The third and fourth lessons are really where the critical pedagogy aspects take center stage. Here, we stress test the concepts of timbre and texture that we’ve already established by focusing specifically on unpitched percussion. And what we find is that we’ve developed more robust terms for discussing texture and timbre as it pertains to _pitched_ instruments, and that _unpitched_ instruments force us to refine and reconsider some of these definitions. And again, you'llsee that these are the lessons that will really support our critical pedagogy mission, because they’re the lessons that involve the most critical thinking from the students.

So, let's dive into these lesson plans!

## 1. Texture in pop music

-- `[CLICK]`

You may already be familiar with my work on this subject. I like Allan Moore's system of four functional layers, and I added a fifth layer, the novelty layer, in a 2020 MTO article. Together, these five layers are **explicit beat, functional bass, harmonic filler, melody, and novelty.** These concepts are honestly not that difficult to catch onto even without formal definitions and theorizing, and you can read about it more elsewhere, so I won't go too in depth right now.

One aspect I want to make clear from the start, and that I clarify with the students too, is that texture is separate from, but intertwined with, timbre. Texture is about how instruments are working together and playing different roles in a song. But we have certain timbral and instrumental expectations for each of these layers, which is what often leads into the timbre discussions.

-- `[CLICK]`

In addition to the MTO article, I've written a chapter on functional layers in my co-authored textbook, _Open Music Theory._ So obviously this is a more student-oriented resource compared to the MTO article, which is for professional nerds like us.

It takes students through the definitions and examples of each of the functional layers defined by Allan Moore and myself. `[scroll briefly through the chapter and definitions; if time allows, demonstrate with Vulfpeck]`

This chapter is not specifically a tuned to EDM, but rather is meant to apply to most popular music genres, including EDM. But actually, I would probably _not_ start with an EDM example. EDM poses particular challenges for timbre and texture analysis, as we'll see soon.

-- `[CLICK]`

### Assignment

I've got two assignments listed at the bottom of the OMT chapter, but the one I usually pick is asking students to make a "layer graph" and analyze the texture of "bad guy" by Billie Eilish. This is mostly a pop song, but it does have a kind of EDM breakdown at the end, and yeah, your students will notice that it got a lot harder to analyze the texture at that point.

I also ask them to think up some answers to these questions:

1. What instruments make up each layer?
2. When do layers enter and exit, and how does that relate to the form?
3. Are any functional layers missing altogether? What is the effect of omitting that layer from the song?
4. How do the rhythmic profiles of the layers differ?
5. How do any of the answers to the questions above relate to genre or cultural context?

Students can then participate in a nice discussion the next day based on their prepared answers to these questions.

### Learning objectives

So by the end of the class, students will be able to:

-   Enumerate and characterize five functional layers of texture in pop music
-   Assign sounds to a functional layer
-   Diagram functional layers in a song
-   Compare functional layers between different pop songs

--- `[CLICK]`

Next up is:

## 2. Timbre vocabulary

-- `[CLICK]`

Texture is easier to talk about when sound sources are easily identified—when the functional bass is played by the bass, the harmonic filler is a guitar, and the melody is a vocalist.

In EDM, though, sound sources are often unclear, like you hear at the end of "bad guy". So you don't get to rely on those clean distinctions between guitar, bass, voice, and drums and their typical roles.

But when sources are unclear, this forces us to talk in terms of timbre. If everything is synth, it's helpful to be able to talk about "that noisy, dark synth" and contrast it with "that bright, inharmonic synth" or whatever.

-- `[CLICK]`

### Lesson plan

I like to begin teaching timbre by defining it in the simplest possible terms—what makes an instrument or voice sound like itself; how we identify sound sources. And I supplement this definition by drawing out what terms for describing timbre students already know. And even non-major students know something about timbre, because every hearing person can assess timbre—it's how we tell different voices apart, for one thing.

Inevitably, opinions start to come out as students offer timbre terms and their meanings. And as disagreement or confusion arises, you can point out that different people understand these words differently, and that's why it's so important to established shared definitions.

As you might imagine, I'm partial to my own set of terms, but for more vocally-focused terms I also really like, for example, Kate Heidemann's, Michele Duguay's, or Victoria Malawey's…there's so many good timbre publications out there nowadays. The key thing is agreeing on what definitions you'll use in your classes.

If I had to pick one major issue I encountered in teaching these lessons, it was that students brought in strong feelings about the meanings of certain words that they were reluctant to let go of. And this is an issue with timbre analysis in general. People already have a vocabulary they're using to describe timbre, but it's often entirely scrutinized, and culturally dependent. A big part of this lesson is getting students to buy into the idea that a shared lexicon is useful, even if that lexicon has imperfections or limited applicability.

-- `[CLICK]`

So anyway, let's pretend we all bought into my lexicon. In a nutshell, I begin a timbre analysis by filling out an opposition table, which looks like this.

Important points:

-   terms are grouped into oppositional pairs; each term helps define its opposite
-   in filling out an opposition table, you use either plus or minus to indicate which oppositional term applies; this allows a birds-eye view of the analytical conclusions
-   these terms are meant to be relatively objectively defined as specific acoustic phenomena
-   fully implemented, the +/- system has specific cultural meanings—markedness—but this can be set aside for the sake of introductory lessons.
-   And you can read more about all of this and where it comes from in my MTO article.

-- `[CLICK]`

In my handout, I have a printable half-page version of that table. For this lesson, I'd go ahead and print out copies for all the students to have at their desks as they're learning and working. And then, I'd pull up that MTO article, and go through each term and its accompanying video example from Section 1 of Lavengood (2020).

-- `[CLICK]`

-- `[CLICK]`

-   Common sticking points:
    -   noisy ≠ bad; relates to noise as an acoustic concept
    -   _rich/sparse_ is similar to _full/hollow_ but doesn't rely on harmonic series

-- `[CLICK]`

-   Small group work: Identify 3 different sounds in "Helix" by Flume and describe the timbre by filling out the opposition table. Identify what seems to be the most important characterteristic(s).
    -   Students can use ± to describe sounds that have both qualities (e.g., because they shift)
-   Presentation and discussion
-   **Assignment: complete an analysis of (5/10/all) of the sounds used in the track.**

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
- Ask each group to explain which sounds and terms they chose
- Discussion questions:
  - Where did two groups analyze the same sounds differently? What might be an explanation?
  - Timbre occurs on a spectrum; how did you decide which term to use?
  - Which terms seemed most useful? Least useful?
  - Did you notice any correspondence between timbre and rhythm, form, etc.?
</aside>

-- `[CLICK]`

### Learning objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

-   Distinguish terms within an oppositional pair of timbre descriptors
-   Assign timbre descriptors to sound signals

--- `[CLICK]`

## 3. Unpitched Percussion Timbre

-- `[CLICK]`

-   Having ~~mastered~~ learned about timbre in the context of pitched instruments, we can see to what extent this vocabulary is useful for unpitched instruments.
-   Many people tune out details of percussion; we will learn to listen closely to percussion instead
-   EDM foregrounds percussion, making it an ideal repertoire to learn with

_This is challenging for many people, especially musicians who have focused extensively on pitch and piched instruments._

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>

I deliberately said "musicians" and not "students" because this can be challenging for instructors also. But as we've mentioned, the spirit of critical pedagogy is to allow ourselves to be uncomfortable and see the students more as equal co-learners.

</aside>

-- `[CLICK]`

### Lesson plan

Preliminaries

-   Define "unpitched percussion"
-   Refer back to Lavengood (2020) timbre vocabulary: what will be less useful? what will be more useful?
-   Distribute [customizable opposition charts](/markdown/2025-edm/edm-timbre-ped-handout.pdf) (printable in handout)

-- `[CLICK]`

-   Intro to Roland TR-909: give a little historical context
-   Have students use devices to access [roland50.studio](roland50.studio), a web-app version of the 909
-   Take a tour of the instrument together to get a sense of the soundscape

-- `[CLICK]`

<!-- .element: data-background-iframe="https://roland50.studio" data-background-interactive -->

-- `[CLICK]`

-   Divide students into groups; have each group analyze different instruments on the 909.
    -   Try to define them by their most distinctive characteristics.
    -   Timbres should be defined relative to the overall sound palette of the TR-909.
    -   Encourage groups to invent new oppositions if needed.
    -   Explain using our established timbre vocabulary what the knobs change in each sound.

-- `[CLICK]`

-   Presentation and reflection
    -   share findings
    -   determine what terms were most useful, including any new terms (e.g., _dry/wet_ may come up—length of decay)

-- `[CLICK]`

### Assignment: [TR-909 "Workout"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtnbR9H48I)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLtnbR9H48I?si=IlX7jUP-tBAYqy_q&amp;start=9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-- `[CLICK]`

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

-   Distinguish terms within an oppositional pair of timbre descriptors
-   Assign timbre descriptors to **unpitched percussion sound signals**

--- `[CLICK]`

## 4. Percussion's Role in Texture

-- `[CLICK]`

-   Students are now more comfortable thinking about percussion
-   Just as percussion problematizes our timbre vocabulary, it also problematizes the texture vocabulary
-   Because percussion is so central to EDM, this repertorie challenges automatic categorization of percussion as belonging to the "explicit beat layer"

-- `[CLICK]`

### Lesson Plan

-   Review functional layer types as defined in [_Open Music Theory_](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/chapter/texture-in-pop-music)
-   Critique: the TR-909 Workout
    -   Do you think these layers exist here? Is everything just “explicit beat layer” [rhetorical question!]?
    -   What aspects of each layer could also be present even in unpitched percussion?

-- `[CLICK]`

Small group work

-   Ask each group to pick one functional layer type (e.g., "functional bass") to focus on
-   Determine which instrument(s) and rhythmic motives belong to their layer type
-   Use, critique, and build on the definition of that layer type

-- `[CLICK]`

Discussion

-   Have groups present their findings
-   How did definitions shift/change through this process?
-   What aspects of each sound led you to put it in your functional layer (timbre, rhythm, etc.)?

-- `[CLICK]`

### Assignment: Jlin, "Hatshepsut"

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; max-width: 700px; height: 120px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2765736108/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=9a64ff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=448110133/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://jlin.bandcamp.com/album/black-origami">Black Origami by Jlin</a></iframe>

In class preparation

-   Listen once all the way through
-   Identify instruments (by name, onomotopoeia, timbre, etc.)

-- `[CLICK]`

Assignment goals:

-   Categorize instruments as belonging to functional layers
-   Transcribe rhythmic motives as needed
-   Use timbre vocabulary as needed
-   Write a 200–300 word reflection: How did you determine which instruments belong to which layer? How did timbre factor into your decisions, if at all? What other musical domains influenced your decisions (rhythm? register? form?)?

-- `[CLICK]`

### Learning objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

-   Critique the five functional layers of texture in pop music
-   Analyze unpitched percussion music with functional layers

--- `[CLICK]`

## Conclusion

-   Timbre and texture study can be used to analyze any type of music
-   Timbre and texture can be difficult to teach, but that's okay—that's part of the lesson!
-   This module develops autonomous students: no tool is perfect; build on existing tools to make something new
