  <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Timbre and texture remain persistently overlooked in undergraduate theory curricula. As a step toward remedying this, I show how to incorporate these topics through EDM, a style of music that eschews melodic and harmonic complexity and thus brings timbre and texture to the forefront of listener perception (Fales 2018). I provide resources and a sequence of critical-pedagogy-based lesson plans for teaching pop music texture and show how EDM songs can problematize and nuance our ideas about texture.\n\nTimbre and texture are special: they are an inherent part of virtually any type of music. When students learn to listen for these musical domains, then, they learn tools for thinking deeply about all sorts of musicâ€”not just Western classical music, and not just EDM. Lessons like these support a central tenet of critical pedagogy by developing well-rounded and autonomous students.">
