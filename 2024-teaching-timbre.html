<aside class='notes'>
I think you’re supposed to begin these things with a relatable vignette, so here is mine. When I first began studying music theory, like a lot of new students, I was interested in using music theory and analysis to explore what made my like my favorite music, and at that time, my favorite music was Sufjan Stevens and especially his 2005 concept album Illinois. And what I liked so much about it was the fragile and expressive quality of Sufjan’s voice and his broad instrumentation, including the expected guitar, bass, keyboard, and drums but also oboe, banjo, trumpet, vibraphone, and things like that. I’m sorry to say that when I first asked a mentor about studying Sufjan’s vocal timbre, particularly the way he renders his vowels, they steered me away from the topic, saying that it was a linguistics project and not a music theory project.
<p>So much has changed since then. I highly doubt that mentor would say the same
thing today. Timbre studies have exploded since about 2015, and in the past
couple years, voice in particular has been enjoying its moment. I just got a
call for papers for an international conference called “New Perspectives on the
Musical Analysis of the Voice,” for example.</p>

            <ul>
<li>Music theory as an area of research has become much more broad and
inclusive.</li>
<li>But without resources, it’s difficult to reflect this in the classrom.</li>
</ul>
<aside class='notes'>
But oftentimes, the broad nature of our academic discipline is not reflected in the curriculum that we teach at our institutions, especially at the undergraduate level. There are lots of reasons for this that I could go into, but I’ll focus on one potential roadblock: that teachers are lacking practical and simple ways to add cutting-edge content in their classrooms when the topics are not covered in textbooks, workbooks, and standard theory pedagogy training.
<p>And there are more reasons to start teaching timbre beyond simply reflecting the field’s academic interests—I believe timbre can be a part of addressing broader shortcomings in music school curricula. In case you’ve been blissfully unaware of the prominent themes in current musicological discourse on this topic, I will quickly articulate what I see as the principal critiques that are relevant to my talk today.</p>

            <h2 class="r-fit-text">Common critiques of theory and aural skills </h2>
<ol class="fragment">
<li class="fragment">Theory classes should discuss more than just classical music. </li>
<li class="fragment">Theory classes spend too much time on form and (especially) pitch.</li>
<li>Theory classes alienate our students, and function as weeder classes that are gatekeeping certain people from studying music in an academic setting, to the detriment of our departments and our field. </li>

<aside class='notes'>
These problems stem from the fact that, as Loren Kajikawa puts it, the vast majority of music departments have invested so much in classical music, even while the influence, significance, and even dominance of other styles of music has grown over the past 100 years.

                <h3>Motivations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Practical concerns about enrollment dips and budget</li>
<li>Ethical concerns about imperialism and exclusion</li>
</ul>
<aside class='notes'>
There's eminently practical concerns that can motivate these critiques. Most of our music programs have seen enrollment dips (because of Covid and budget cuts and general undervaluing of learning for learning sake—but that’s a whole other presentation). As programs realize they need to reach out to more people, they are reconsidering this exclusive focus on classical music. For example, we can’t assume all incoming freshmen have taken years of private lessons on their instruments, so programs may remove audition requirements altogether or add applied music technology as a primary instrument option. Programs may develop a music BA that is focused more on music studies than on performance. When programs do these sorts of things, it throws the traditional music theory curriculum into question. If students have not auditioned on an instrument, or don’t even play a traditional music school instrument, then we can no longer assume our students have spent years honing their ability to read notation. If a substantial chunk of your student population is majoring in music technology, music therapy, music business, or music studies, then classical music is unlikely to be relevant to their academic or career goals. A theory curriculum needs to be equipped to deal with this if the music department is going to stay afloat financially. 
<p>CLICK</p>
<p>But there’s also a philosophical, ethical, moral concern that can spur the same critiques: the concern that theory is a colonizing force in music studies and music making. This struck me most when I read Dylan Robinson’s book, Hungry Listening, and Robin Attis’s work on decolonizing music curricula.</p>

<aside class='notes'>
 One thing that makes theory “colonizing” according to these authors is the way we break musical works down into component parts to study them out-of-time and in detail. And if that activity is what music theory is—and I think that’s basically true—then honestly, I wonder if it's even possible for music theory to be decolonizing in any way. Certainly I’m not the best person to be reflecting on this, since my positionality as a white woman with the privilege of private piano lessons and traditional university music study means that I have a pretty substantial conflict of interest that I can’t pretend I am able to set aside. Like, I’m going to be pretty loath to admit that the subject I’ve essentially spent my entire life specializing in is now irrelevant and harmful to a 21st-century world. So bearing that big disclaimer in mind,

            <section >
                <h3>What can we do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Appropriately circumscribe our work and recognize our positionality</li>
<li>Learn how to look at music in new and more holistic ways</li>
</ul>
<aside class='notes'>
I guess my take on it is that, even if music theorists can't be truly decolonizing in our work, we can at a minimum appropriately circumscribe our work, and even better, we can learn from the literature and philosophy of decolonization how to look upon music in new ways. If we do that, not only would we do less harm, but we would also enrich our field.
