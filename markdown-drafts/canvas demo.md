## Course setup

Canvas has a pretty good guide on this built in.

<div style="float: right;">
    <img class="r-frame" src="right-home-menu.png">
</div>
<div style="width:70%;">
    <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
        * When on your home page, this menu appears on the right
        * select "Course Setup Checklist" for a walkthrough
        </textarea>
    </section>
</div>

---

## Communication

Why use Canvas for communication?

-   Always synced up with enrollment, so more reliable than email lists on your computer
-   Ability to easily select subgroups of students (e.g., only those who have no submission)
-   Storing messages that students may need to refer to again later

--

### [Announcements](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-an-announcement-in-a-course/ta-p/1194)

-   Course Announcements will email all your students after you post it. (You do not get a copy of the email yourself.)
-   Announcements are good for when you want a record of the communication, e.g., because students may need to refer to it later, or because you want to clearly show that you communicated a deadline etc.
-   In Settings, you can turn on an option to show Announcements on the course homepage (like in Blackboard).

--

### [Message from gradebook](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-send-a-message-to-students-from-the-Gradebook/ta-p/741)

-   This option is useful for sending reminders to submit homework, opportunities to revise, etc.
-   Options:
    -   Have submitted
    *   Have not yet submitted
    *   Have not been graded
    *   Scored less than [point value]
    *   Scored more than [point value]
    *   Reassigned

--

### [Message from inbox](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-send-a-message-to-a-user-in-a-course-in-the-Inbox/ta-p/616669)

-   The closest thing to the "Send email" button in Blackboard, but
-   Actually a Canvas message, which will also get emailed to you/the student, and to which people can reply via email or on Canvas.
-   Note that you can't email a class if the class is unpublished.

---

## Fitting your content into Canvas

-   Major difference from Blackboard: Canvas keeps the content you upload in one central location, and reuses that content to fill in different parts of your course. **Assignments, modules, gradebook, and syllabus are all interconnected.**
-   This encourages (forces?) you to use Assignments in a way that Blackboard didn't.
-   Advantage: you are less likely to end up inadvertently giving students conflicting information.

## Blackboard migrations

<div style='float: right; width:30%;'>
<img class='r-frame' src='right-home-menu.png'>
</div>
<div style='width:70%;'>
<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
* Students cannot be added directly to your migrated course. The migrated course is for you alone.
* Use **Import existing content** on the right menu on your home page to import things from the migrated course to your new Canvas course.
* You should probably plan to start from scratch rather than rely on the migration.
</textarea>
</section>
</div>

### [GMU guide on Blackboard migrations](https://its.gmu.edu/knowledge-base/canvas-course-migration-guide)

GMU put together a thorough [guide](https://its.gmu.edu/knowledge-base/canvas-course-migration-guide) on what to watch out for in your migrated course.

## [Assignment Groups](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-weight-the-final-course-grade-based-on-assignment/ta-p/746)

<div style='float: right;width:30%;'>
<img class='r-frame' src='asst-groups.png'>
<img class='r-frame' src='asst-weight.png'>
</div>
<div style='width:70%;'>
    <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
After you decide on the weighting for your course grade, you can set up Assignment Groups accordingly

_(Note that within the assignment groups, assignments are weighted proportionally to their point value.)_ </textarea> </section>

</div>

--

### [Assignment Groups](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-weight-the-final-course-grade-based-on-assignment/ta-p/746)

This information then appears on the Assignments page and the Syllabus page.

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:space-between;">
    <div><img class="r-frame" src='asst-weight-asst.png'></div>
    <div><img class="r-frame" src='asst-weight-syllabus.png'></div>
</div>

(because remember these are all linked up)

---

## [Assignments](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-assignment-types-can-I-create-in-a-course/ta-p/627)

Canvas "Assignments" include

-   Assignments
-   Discussions
-   Quizzes

--

### [Gradebook](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Gradebook/ta-p/701)

-   Unlike Blackboard, you can't just create grade columns in the gradebook and enter grades for the students. **All grade columns are linked to assignments that you've made on Canvas.**
-   So even for assignments that are on paper or that have no submission, **you still need to create those as Assignments in Canvas.**

--

### Why you should make Canvas Assignments

This seems annoying probably, but here are the good things:

-   Forces a standardization across classes that students appreciate
-   You can put those Assignments in their proper Assignment Group to illustrate how the weighting works
-   All the Assignments and due dates you enter are all listed on the syllabus automatically.

--

### Same item cross-linked in different places

<div style="text-align:right;"><img style="margin:0;" src="same-item-3.png" alt="in Assignments">
<img style="margin:0;" src="same-item-2.png" alt="in Modules">
<img style="margin:0;" src="same-item-1.png" alt="in Gradebook">
<img style="margin:0;" src="same-item-4.png" alt="in Syllabus"></div>

--

### Assignment submission options

A lot of us probably have "assignments" that would not actually be submitted on Canvas.

When you create an Assignment, you can select how students should submit:

-   No submission
-   Online
-   On paper
-   External tool
-   Lucid

--

### [Assignments submitted online](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-an-online-assignment/ta-p/950)

Select how the students submit:

-   Text Entry
-   Website URL
-   **Media Recordings**
-   Student Annotation
-   **File Uploads**

Note that even if you select multiple submission types, students can only submit one way; they can't, for example, have a media recording _and_ a file upload in their submission. :\(

--

### Media Recording submissions vs File Upload

Media Recording submissions are nice because you can view the submissions in-browser, without downloading files.

You can also request media files as File Uploads, but you will have to download the files to access them.

--

### Plagiarism detection

You can select Turnitin plagiarism detection for assignments that are submitted online that are text entries or file uploads.

--

### [Rubrics](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-rubric-to-an-assignment/ta-p/1058)

_After_ you save an Assignment, you can add a rubric, either new or one that you already made.

![](rubrics.png) <!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

--

### [Rubric options](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-rubric-to-an-assignment/ta-p/1058)

![](rubrics.png) <!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

-   Make sure to check **Use this rubric for assignment grading** if this is how you are assigning grades!
-   I have a tool for bulk-importing rubrics from CSVs, if you're comfortable with getting a little techy…

---

## [Modules](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Modules-Index-Page/ta-p/926)

Modules are where you can mix together your Assignments and other material (readings, videos, etc.)

--

### What is a module?

<div style='float: right; width:30%;'>
<img class='r-frame' src='module.png'>
</div>
<div style='width:70%;'>
<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
    * Modules don't have any default organization structure—everything is drag-and-drop
    * So, modules can be whatever you need them to be:
      * indications of modules in the course (coherent units organized in time)
      * groupings of different sorts of material (important info, readings, videos, headers)
</textarea>
</section>
</div>

--

### [Organizing a module](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-move-or-reorder-a-module-item/ta-p/1126)

<div style='float: right; width:30%;'>
<img class='r-frame' src='module.png'>
</div>
<div style='width:70%;'>
<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
    * Again, this is all done manually, so totally customizable, but
    * Recommended organization:
      * order by due date
      * use indentation to show subgroupings
</textarea>
</section>
</div>

_Here, I've put readings at the leftmost indentation level; assignments related to those readings are indented by 1 level to show that "this reading → this assignment"_
