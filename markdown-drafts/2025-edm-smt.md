## Inspiration

Cornelia Fales, "Hearing Timbre: Perceptual Learning among Early Bay Area Ravers"

-   EDM (generally) avoids complex, teleological chord progressions and vocals
-   These elements demand attention when present
-   **When absent, listeners can focus more easily on timbre**
-   EDM aficionados actually see this timbral attentiveness as hearing EDM "correctly"

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>

Legendary timbre scholar Cornelia Fales wrote a book chapter in 2018 that used the archives of a listserv to perform digital ethnography on a group of 1990s ravers.

The article discusses a connection between the fringe status of EDM (at the time at least) and its "nonspecificity." She documents that these EDM listeners prioritized nonspecificity in their timbres by preferring timbres with ambiguous or disconnected sound sources, and rejecting vocals with meaningful lyrics as distracting and disruptive.

Citing perception studies, Fales argues that the musical features of EDM actually promote and support timbral attentiveness. This is important for pedagogues of timbre: by de-emphasizing more familiar domains of focus, we can more easily get students to pay attention to timbre.

As a bonus, it turns out that according to Fales's research, listening in this way can improve one's appreciation for EDM. It's true that much EDM lacks vocals, easily-identifiable instruments, and some music theory comfort objects like teleological progressions. This can make EDM seem hard to understand, but if we learn to hear in this new timbre-focused way, we would be hearing more like the EDM community would.

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
This chapter take students through the definitions and examples of each of the functional layers defined by Alan Moore and myself. This chapter is not specifically a tuned to EDM, but rather is meant to apply to most popular music genres, including EDM. I would not start with an EDM example, however. EDM poses particular challenges for timber and texture analysis.

## 1. Texture in pop music

### Assignment

-   Creating a layer graph to represent functional layers in "bad guy" by Billie Eilish (2018) using [Auralayer](https://brianedwardjarvis.com/auralayer/home.html)
-   Discussion questions
    1. What instruments make up each layer?
    2. When do layers enter and exit, and how does that relate to the form?
    3. Are any functional layers missing altogether? What is the effect of omitting that layer from the song?
    4. How do the rhythmic profiles of the layers differ?
    5. How do any of the answers to the questions above relate to genre or cultural context?

## 1. Texture in pop music

### Takeaways

-   Texture is separate from but intertwined with timbre
-   Texture is easier to talk about when sound sources are easily identified, as in pop-rock
-   In EDM, sound sources are unclear; more challenging
-   But when sources are unclear, this forces us to talk in terms of **timbre**

## 2. Timbre vocabulary

### Learning objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

-   Distinguish terms within an oppositional pair of timbre descriptors
-   Assign timbre descriptors to sound signals

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
One major issue I encountered in teaching these timbre terms was that students brought in strong feelings about the meanings of certain words. And this is an issue with timbre analysis in general. People already have a vocabulary they're using to describe timbre, but it's often entirely scrutinized, and culturally dependent. A big part of this lesson is getting students to buy into the idea that a shared lexicon is useful, even if that lexicon has imperfections or limited applicability.

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 2. Timbre vocabulary

### Lesson plan

-   Define timbre briefly (what makes an instrument or voice sound like itself; how we identify sound sources)
-   Ask students for their own examples of timbre terms; as disagreement or confusion arises, point out that different people understand these words differently, and so it's important to established shared definitions
-   Offer [Lavengood (2020)](https://mtosmt.org/issues/mto.20.26.3/mto.20.26.3.lavengood.html) as one option to stick with for the module

Opposition Table Example

|    opposition<br/> − / + | [some sound]</br>&nbsp; |
| -----------------------: | :---------------------: |
|          _bright / dark_ |            -            |
|           _pure / noisy_ |            +            |
|          _full / hollow_ |            -            |
|          _rich / sparse_ |          etc.           |
|     _beatless / beating_ |                         |
|  _harmonic / inharmonic_ |                         |
|    _percussive / legato_ |                         |
| _bright / dark_ (attack) |                         |
|             _low / high_ |                         |
|      _steady / wavering_ |                         |

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
Important points:

-   terms are grouped into oppositional pairs; each term helps define its opposite
-   in filling out an opposition table, you use either plus or minus to indicate which oppositional term applies; this allows a birds-eye view of the analytical conclusions
-   these terms are meant to be relatively objectively defined as specific acoustic phenomena
-   fully implemented, the +/- system has specific cultural meanings—markedness—but this can be set aside for the sake of introductory lessons.
-   can read more on MTO.

## 2. Timbre vocabulary

### Lesson plan

-   Hand out [opposition charts](/img/edm/edm-timbre-ped-handout.pdf) (printable from handout)
-   Go through each term and its accompanying video example from Section 1 of Lavengood (2020)
-   Common sticking points:
    -   noisy ≠ bad; relates to noise as an acoustic concept
    -   _rich/sparse_ is similar to _full/hollow_ but doesn't rely on harmonic series

--

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 2. Timbre vocabulary

### Lesson plan

-   Small group work: Identify 3 different sounds in "Helix" by Flume and describe the timbre by filling out the opposition table. Identify what seems to be the most important characterteristic(s).
    -   Students can use ± to describe sounds that have both qualities (e.g., because they shift)
-   Presentation and discussion
-   **Assignment: complete an analysis of (5/10/all) of the sounds used in the track.**

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
- Ask each group to explain which sounds and terms they chose
- Discussion questions:
  - Where did two groups analyze the same sounds differently? What might be an explanation?
  - Timbre occurs on a spectrum; how did you decide which term to use?
  - Which terms seemed most useful? Least useful?
  - Did you notice any correspondence between timbre and rhythm, form, etc.?

## 2. Timbre vocabulary

### Takeaways

-   Timbre is especially useful when instruments aren't useful identifiers
-   Timbre is perceptually influenced and contextual
-   Sometimes terms mean different things to different people

## 3. Unpitched percussion timbre

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

-   Distinguish terms within an oppositional pair of timbre descriptors
-   Assign timbre descriptors to **unpitched percussion sound signals**

_This is challenging for many people, especially musicians who have focused extensively on pitch and piched instruments._

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>

I deliberately said "musicians" and not "students" because this can be challenging for instructors also. But as we've mentioned, the spirit of critical pedagogy is to allow ourselves to be uncomfortable and see the students more as equal co-learners.

## 3. Unpitched percussion timbre

### Lesson plan

Preliminaries

-   Define "unpitched percussion"
-   Refer back to Lavengood (2020) timbre vocabulary: what will be less useful? what will be more useful?
-   Distribute [customizable opposition charts](/img/edm/edm-timbre-ped-handout.pdf) (printable in handout)

--

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 3. Unpitched percussion timbre

### Lesson plan

-   Intro to Roland TR-909: give a little historical context
-   Have students use devices to access [roland50.studio](roland50.studio), a web-app version of the 909
-   Take a tour of the instrument together to get a sense of the soundscape

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 3. Unpitched percussion timbre

### Lesson plan

-   Divide students into groups; have each group analyze different instruments on the 909.
    -   Try to define them by their most distinctive characteristics.
    -   Timbres should be defined relative to the overall sound palette of the TR-909.
    -   Encourage groups to invent new oppositions if needed.
    -   Explain using our established timbre vocabulary what the knobs change in each sound.

--

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 3. Unpitched percussion timbre

### Lesson plan

-   Presentation and reflection
    -   share findings
    -   determine what terms were most useful, including any new terms (e.g., _dry/wet_ may come up—length of decay)

## 4. Percussion's Role in Texture

### Learning objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

-   Critique the five functional layers of texture in pop music
-   Analyze unpitched percussion music with functional layers

--

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 4. Percussion's Role in Texture

### Lesson Plan

-   Review functional layer types as defined in [_Open Music Theory_](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/chapter/texture-in-pop-music)
-   Critique: the TR-909 Workout
    -   Do you think these layers exist here? Is everything just “explicit beat layer” [rhetorical question!]?
    -   What aspects of each layer could also be present even in unpitched percussion?

--

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 4. Percussion's Role in Texture

### Lesson Plan

Small group work

-   Ask each group to pick one functional layer type (e.g., "functional bass") to focus on
-   Determine which instrument(s) and rhythmic motives belong to their layer type
-   Use, critique, and build on the definition of that layer type

--

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 4. Percussion's Role in Texture

### Lesson Plan

Discussion

-   Have groups present their findings
-   How did definitions shift/change through this process?
-   What aspects of each sound led you to put it in your functional layer (timbre, rhythm, etc.)?

-   Listen once all the way through
-   Identify instruments (by name, onomotopoeia, timbre, etc.)

--

<!-- .element: data-auto-animate="true" -->

## 4. Percussion's Role in Texture

### Assignment: Jlin, "Hatshepsut"

Assignment goals:

-   Categorize instruments as belonging to functional layers
-   Transcribe rhythmic motives as needed
-   Use timbre vocabulary as needed
-   Write a 200–300 word reflection: How did you determine which instruments belong to which layer? How did timbre factor into your decisions, if at all? What other musical domains influenced your decisions (rhythm? register? form?)?

---

## Conclusion

-   Timbre and texture study can be used to analyze any type of music
-   Timbre and texture can be difficult to teach, but that's okay—that's part of the lesson!
-   This module develops autonomous students: no tool is perfect; build on existing tools to make something new
