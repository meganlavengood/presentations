Begin with questions about who's here: majors? prior experience with pop? know any pop theory? where might you be teaching pop music in your future?

## Inclusion and pop music

* Pop music is often more familiar to students than classical music
* Pop music is often not notated, so focusing on pop music can reach out to students who don't know notation very well

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>

A little bit about my personal background: 

- began piano lessons early
- church music was always a big part of my life: choir, handbells, playing in the contemporary service band
- in my free time, learned pop songs by ear to play and sing
- played a lot of ragtime, jazz arrangements, video game music arrangements, and things like that in my piano lessons
- attempted jazz piano but couldn't get the hang of it
- realized in high school that I needed to get good at classical music to get into college for music
- trained a lot in classical music thorughout my education
- finally went back to pop music for my dissertation and research and found my niche.
- teach pop music theory now to my undergrad students and grad students.

Begin with questions about who's here: majors? prior experience with pop? know any pop theory? where might you be teaching pop music in your future?

## Talk overview <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Pop music can be used to promote inclusion, but its effectiveness here depends on how it's implemented.

- Less effective methods
	- Token examples of pop music
	- Pop music classes as upper-level electives
- More effective: teaching pop on its own terms
	- example syllabus of pop theory class
	- ideas for including pop performance
- Example concepts of pop music theory

---


## Tokenized pop music <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

**Tokenization:** when something outside the norm is included and represented, but in a way that still ultimately serves and reinforces the norm

Example: in a lesson about valid classical chord progressions, an example by Billy Joel is included. 

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>

I'm a music theorist, so I've spent most of my time thinking about this from that perspective. I know most of you don't and may never have any say in a music theory curriculum at a university, but I just want to talk about it a bit as an example of the issues I'm discussing.

</aside>

--

## Traditional theory curriculum <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

Four semesters:

1. fundamentals
2. diatonic harmony (chord progressions, cadences, four-part writing)
3. chromatic harmony
4. form or 20th century (set theory and serialism)

--

## Theory textbooks <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

- Representative of mainstream approaches to theory pedagogy
- Focus on one (niche) textbook today: Turek, *Theory for Today’s Musician*

--

## Turek intro to teachers

- Pop music should be included for “today’s musician”
- Pop will bridge the gap between what students already know and what we are trying to teach them

**What are the problems and assumptions with this attitude?**

--

## Pop examples in the Turek book <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

[add specifics]

--

## Problems with token examples <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

- Age of examples?
- Demographics of artists/composers?
- Representative of pop music in general?
- Relationship to overall learning goals?

--

## Performance version of token examples <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

* Focus remains primarily on classical music
* But one (notated) arrangement of a pop song is included every now and then, as a treat

---

## Pop Electives <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

- When schools do have a pop courses, they are often electives
- Students may take it or skip it
- Available after completing the core curriculum
- If gen ed, may not count as part of music degree requirements

--

## Problems with pop electives <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

- Who gets to take it?
- When do they get to take it?
- Implied value of subject?
- Are prerequisite classes really needed?
- Gatekeeping?

---

## Good Practices <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

To be as inclusive as possible, pop music needs to be treated as equally complex and valid when compared to classical music.

--

## Good Practices <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

- Teach pop music as a robust repertoire with its own compositional techniques and analytical approaches
- Be thoughtful when assuming knowledge (what is truly needed beforehand?)
- Aim for broad representation across time periods, artist demographics, and genres

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
For the rest of the talk, I want to imagine what it might look like to take pop music more seriously. I have heard skepticism that there is enough depth in pop music to justify spending a lot of time on it. So let's explore how  we can create an inclusive and meaningful experience with pop music in our classrooms. Where is the complexity of pop music? How can we promote it as an equally valid repertoire?

## Good Practices in pop music theory <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

Develop a theory class that:

* Focuses entirely (or in large part) on popular music
* Counts as the core curriculum
* Is accessible to BAs (who don't need to take as many theory courses usually)
* Does not rely on fluency in music notation

--

## Example list of topics <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

* Melody and phrasing
* Verse-chorus form
* AABA form and strophic form
* Rhythm and Meter in Pop Music
* Harmonic schemas (4-chord schemas, puff, classical, blues-based, modal)
* Fragile, Absent, and Emergent Tonics
* Drumbeats
* Texture in pop music
* Text Setting in Pop Music

--

## Prerequisite knowledge <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

* Aural skills (tonic-finding, pitch matching, listening to bass register)
* Diatonic keys, scales, and chords
* Roman numerals
* Music notation (but just basics)
* Meter

---

## Good practices in ensembles and applied lessons <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

How could pop music be included in an ensemble curriculum or private lesson curriculum, where classical music is often studied exclusively?

- Ensembles dedicated to the performance of pop music exclusively (rock bands, a cappella groups, pep bands, marching bands)
- Pop music aural skills
- Creating arrangements of pop tunes

--

## Pop music aural skills <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

**Aural skills are paramount for pop music, which is hardly ever notated.**

- Playing melodies by ear
- Playing bass lines by ear (especially challenging for a lot of people!)
- Improvising a part appropriate to your instrument
- Listening for percussion
- Identifying tonic (more complex in pop, where modes are more common and chord progressions more ambiguous)

---

## Arranging pop tunes <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

Musicians often need to adapt music to the ensemble they have (with pop repertoire or other repertoire!)

Skills to develop:

- Learning when notation is needed or not
- Dealing with complex syncopation
- Adapting a song's form to different situations
- Adapting vocal melodies to instruments and vice-versa

--

## Using notation <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

When used, notation must be implemented thoughtfully.

::: .container
::: .col

### Pros

* Good at specificity
* Visual aid

::: 
::: .col

### Cons 

* Hard to show some syncopations
* Does not reflect real-life practice
* Excludes people who don't read well

:::
:::

--

## Syncopation <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

* More accurate and precise transcription, or simplified transcription?
* Extrapolating freer performance of rhythm from simplifid notation
* Representation of polyrhythms (dotted notes vs. ties)

--

## Form <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

* Writing new intros, outros, interludes, breakdowns, solo sections, etc.
* Where to loop or cut the song for cases where the music needs to be longer or shorter
* [Example assignment: wedding arrangement](https://gmuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/mlavengo_gmu_edu/ESezbpGaM1dKtrGedA-YX3cB0ebfepNG3qbbaLr_1sQhuA)

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
If more content is needed, can discuss the Wedding Arrangement assignment.

--

## Instrumentation <!-- .element: class='r-fit-text' -->

* Adapting instrumental lines to vocals (a cappella syllables and techniques, writing singable lines)
* Adapting vocal lines to instrumentals (compensating for lack of lyrics)

## Tell me why-ee

"Three music school anecdotes" 

Loren Kajikawa, <br>“The Possessive Investment in Classical Music: <br>Confronting Legacies of White Supremacy in U.S. Schools and Departments of Music"<br>(2019)

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
A young rap artist is a student at College. She has been writing songs and recording in her bedroom studio since middle school. Although she is beginning to attract the attention of other artists and fans across the country, she is majoring in journalism and doesn’t see any reason to be involved with the music department. 

A recent PhD in ethnomusicology is hired by the School of Music at University as an adjunct instructor. His job is to teach courses in popular and world music that enroll well and bring much-needed tuition dollars to the school. Although his work is essential to the school, he remains on a year-to-year contract while professors teaching about classical music receive tenure and make twice his salary. 

The gospel choir is one of the most popular ensembles in the Department of Music at College. The director of the group, an African American, appears alongside her students in brochures touting the vitality of the institution. However, the gospel choir does not actually count toward ensemble requirements for the music degree, and most of the students in the choir are nonmajors. In fact, professors in the music department warn their students not to sing with the choir because they might pick up bad habits.

**What would we gain by promoting pop music within formal music study?**

* Including new kinds of musicians, as both as students and teachers
* Increase the relevance of formal music study to 21st-century life
* Counter the prominent assumption that classical's prestige is earned, as it is the smartest and most developed music

--

By and large, music schools are actually *classical* music schools. 

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
Loren Kajikawa explains how part of the reason music schools have been so slow to incorporate popular music and other styles into the curriculum is because they've literally invested a lot of resources into the study of classical music. Pianos, scores, and and concert halls have been purchased. Faculty with that expertise have been hired and tenured. Courses are established. This is why it's so much easier to just drop in some token examples of pop music into the existing curriculum than it is to really create pop music courses and ensembles from the ground up. 

The dominance of classical music in our music programs is so normalized that a significant chunk of people might not realize the implications and significance of a university program that focuses on the works of a handful of European composers, mostly Austro-German, mostly men, often referred to as "masters" or "geniuses." 

But what other departments at a university are similar? Music is behind the times in this way. One way of representing more kinds of folks is through pop music.

</aside>

When we focus so exclusively on classical music, we exclude lots of music and musicians from our school communities.

<aside class='notes'>

While our modern sensibilities would like to believe that music is colorblind and that everyone is equal in our music schools, historically speaking, classical music was an exclusively white American and white European endeavor. 

I think a lot of people internalize harmful ideas about classical versus pop music without realizing the implications of them, or the way that others can weaponize them. Ideas like

- pitch complexity is a mark of intelligent music
- pop music is not meant to be taken seriously
- instrumental music is more complex than vocal music
- classical music is a universal language
- rap and country are especially simple genres
- only classical music theory is extensively developed and systematized

can all be used to marginalize women, poor people, and people of color—intentionally or unintentionally.

None of this is to say that we should not study classical music, or that the study of classical music is racist or sexist or anything like that. Instead, I want to encourage the idea that we can make room for more kinds of music within the formal study of music. 

It's true that this might mean that some people spend less time on classical music. Some people will choose pop classes over classical classes. But I don't think it's a zero-sum game. I believe that by promoting more kinds of music in our departments, more people will actually get involved. Maybe some of them will become interested in classical music. Maybe they won't! Regardless, their presence in our community enriches us all.
