<!-- [sufjan slide] -->

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
I think you’re supposed to begin these things with a relatable vignette, so here is mine. When I first began studying music theory, like a lot of new students, I was interested in using music theory and analysis to explore what made my like my favorite music, and at that time, my favorite music was Sufjan Stevens and especially his 2005 concept album Illinois. And what I liked so much about it was the fragile and expressive quality of Sufjan’s voice and his broad instrumentation, including the expected guitar, bass, keyboard, and drums but also oboe, banjo, trumpet, vibraphone, and things like that. I’m sorry to say that when I first asked a mentor about studying Sufjan’s vocal timbre, particularly the way he renders his vowels, they steered me away from the topic, saying that it was a linguistics project and not a music theory project.

So much has changed since then. I highly doubt that mentor would say the same thing today. Timbre studies have exploded since about 2015, and in the past couple years, voice in particular has been enjoying its moment. I just got a call for papers for an international conference called “New Perspectives on the Musical Analysis of the Voice,” for example.

-   Music theory as an area of research has become much more broad and inclusive.
-   But without resources, it's difficult to reflect this in the classrom.

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
But oftentimes, the broad nature of our academic discipline is not reflected in the curriculum that we teach at our institutions, especially at the undergraduate level. There are lots of reasons for this that I could go into, but I’ll focus on one potential roadblock: that teachers are lacking practical and simple ways to add cutting-edge content in their classrooms when the topics are not covered in textbooks, workbooks, and standard theory pedagogy training.

And there are more reasons to start teaching timbre beyond simply reflecting the field’s academic interests—I believe timbre can be a part of addressing broader shortcomings in music school curricula. In case you’ve been blissfully unaware of the prominent themes in current musicological discourse on this topic, I will quickly articulate what I see as the principal critiques that are relevant to my talk today.

## Common critiques of theory and aural skills <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

1. Theory classes should discuss more than just classical music.
2. Theory classes spend too much time on form and (especially) pitch.
3. Theory classes alienate our students, and function as weeder classes that are gatekeeping certain people from studying music in an academic setting, to the detriment of our departments and our field.

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
These problems stem from the fact that, as Loren Kajikawa puts it, the vast majority of music departments have invested so much in classical music, even while the influence, significance, and even dominance of other styles of music has grown over the past 100 years.

### Motivations

-   Practical concerns about enrollment dips and budget
-   Ethical concerns about imperialism and exclusion

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
There's eminently practical concerns that can motivate these critiques. Most of our music programs have seen enrollment dips (because of Covid and budget cuts and general undervaluing of learning for learning sake—but that’s a whole other presentation). As programs realize they need to reach out to more people, they are reconsidering this exclusive focus on classical music. For example, we can’t assume all incoming freshmen have taken years of private lessons on their instruments, so programs may remove audition requirements altogether or add applied music technology as a primary instrument option. Programs may develop a music BA that is focused more on music studies than on performance. When programs do these sorts of things, it throws the traditional music theory curriculum into question. If students have not auditioned on an instrument, or don’t even play a traditional music school instrument, then we can no longer assume our students have spent years honing their ability to read notation. If a substantial chunk of your student population is majoring in music technology, music therapy, music business, or music studies, then classical music is unlikely to be relevant to their academic or career goals. A theory curriculum needs to be equipped to deal with this if the music department is going to stay afloat financially.

But there’s also a philosophical, ethical, moral concern that can spur the same critiques: the concern that theory is a colonizing force in music studies and music making. This struck me most when I read Dylan Robinson's book, _Hungry Listening_, and Robin Attas’s work on decolonizing music curricula.

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
 One thing that makes theory “colonizing” according to these authors is the way we break musical works down into component parts to study them out-of-time and in detail. And if that activity is what music theory is—and I think that’s basically true—then honestly, I wonder if it's even possible for music theory to be decolonizing in any way. Certainly I’m not the best person to be reflecting on this, since my positionality as a white woman with the privilege of private piano lessons and traditional university music study means that I have a pretty substantial conflict of interest that I can’t pretend I am able to set aside. Like, I’m going to be pretty loath to admit that the subject I’ve essentially spent my entire life specializing in is now irrelevant and harmful to a 21st-century world. So bearing that big disclaimer in mind,

### What can we do?

-   Appropriately circumscribe our work and recognize our positionality
-   Learn how to look at music in new and more holistic ways

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
I guess my take on it is that, even if music theorists can't be truly decolonizing in our work, we can at a minimum appropriately circumscribe our work, and even better, we can learn from the literature and philosophy of decolonization how to look upon music in new ways. If we do that, not only would we do less harm, but we would also enrich our field.

One example of what I think of as a kind of colonizer’s outlook on music theory is when people who have only learned a little bit of music theory decide that they want to write music that emulates another style of music with which they're not terribly familiar. This seems to be a common impulse among budding composers, especially nowadays in this era of musical omnivorousness.

I’m thinking in particular about the time I spent as a moderator of the music theory subreddit. There, I regularly saw posts from users who wanted help understanding how they could create an Arabic sound, or a psychedelic sound, or whatever. And their question would be “what scales do I use?” or “what chords do I use?”, because they were posting in a music theory subreddit for help, and they believed that music theory was based around scales and chords. The question is fundamentally flawed because really what makes these things sound like they are participating in those cultures or genres doesn't have very much to do with scales or chords. And now we’re getting to my pet projects, because in my opinion, emulating a style generally has more to do with timbre and instrumentation and texture.

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>
We're already running up against the problem I brought up a minute ago, that music theory can't really be decolonizing. Because even if I go on to answer this question with information about timbre and texture, that answer is still trying to make those other kinds of music digestible for a newcomer, in precisely the kind of way that Dylan Robinson criticizes—this is basically a quintessential example of “hungry listening” and extractive work. So to be clear, I am not saying that the study of timbre would fix all our problems. But I do think that broadening the tools that we introduce in basic music theory to include timbre and texture would promote a more comprehensive understanding of what goes on in music, and that’s a good and helpful thing.

So far I’ve been mostly philosophizing, and I do want to do some of that in this talk, but I also want to be concrete and practical. For the remainder of the talk, my plan is to

## Five "Conceptions" of timbre <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

1. Timbre as sound-source identifcation
2. Acoustics of timbre
3. Perceived timbre
4. Timbre semantics
5. Polyphonic timbre

[Stephen McAdams, “‘What Is Timbre?’ vs. ‘What Can We Do with Timbre?’: Picking the Right Questions” (2018)](https://www.zotero.org/mlavengood/collections/TJALUVK7/item-list)

<!-- .element: style="font-size: large;"-->

<aside class='notes' data-markdown>

Teaching timbre must first begin with defining it, and this is a notoriously tricky task. One of the most helpful definitions I’ve encountered comes from a presentation from Stephen McAdams, in which he enumerates five separate conceptions of timbre, as follows:

1. Timbre as sound-source identification, which talks about a kind of macrotimbre of each instrument—the “timbre” of a clarinet, for example.
2. Acoustics of timbre, which understands timbre as a physical and measurable phenomenon, like temperature.
3. Perceived timbre, that is, timbre as perceived in the mind of a listener. Perceived timbre is informed not just by the physical properties of the sound source but also by associations made in the listener’s mind.
4. Timbre semantics, which is focused on understanding and refining vocabularies of timbre.
5. Ensemble or polyphonic timbre; that is, consideration of the total timbre that arises from a combination of sound sources playing together.

All of these five ways of understanding timbre are valuable scholarly fields of inquiry, but to what extent could they map onto the classes we offer undergraduate music majors? I’ll go through each.

</aside>

## Perceived timbre

-   Music perception and cognition
-   Cultural musicology

Both require particular modes of research and thinking that are not typically engaged in theory classes

<aside class='notes'>
I’ll start with perceived timbre, because I think that’s most outside the scope for my present discussion. Timbre perception can be studied through two lenses: perception and cognition and cultural musicology. Perception and cognition uses more quantitative methods to capture the way we think about timbre—for example, through listener dissimilarity ratings. Both of these could certainly be taught to undergraduates, but I think probably not within the traditional theory or aural skills curriculum. They might be a better fit in a course on music cognition (which often is grouped with music theory disciplinarily, but is in my opinion rather different in its aims and methods) or musicology, respectively. 
</aside>

--

## Acoustics

-   Research uses software and hardware that may be inaccessible or difficult for many undergraduate students
-   Better suited to music technology class

<aside class='notes'>
The other view of timbre that I won’t discuss much today is the acoustics of timbre. Measuring the physical, acoustic attributes of timbre involves the use of software and possibly even recording equipment. This is something I do in my own research, for example, on the Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and in Sega Genesis sound. It involves capturing sound samples and importing those samples into a program like Sonic Visualiser and Izotope RX. This kind of work wouldn’t be impossible to implement in a typical theory or aural skills classroom, and maybe at some institutions—like tech schools with lots of computing resources and student interest in that—but in many cases, there would be difficulty in getting all students fluent with the software, and that’s presuming they all would have access to the hardware they’d need. With that in mind, I’d imagine this kind of timbre learning would, for most people, be better suited to a music technology class.
</aside>

## Sound-source identification

-   Great for fundamentals and aural skills; important basis for later work too
-   Activity: identifying instruments by ear, with increasing precision and nuance

<aside class='notes'>
Timbre as sound-source identification comes first in this list because it is the most basic and essential kind of engagement with timbre. This is the part of timbre that is biological impulse and a survival skill. When we hear a sound we don’t expect, we ask ourselves, “what was that?” One time last summer, there was an extremely loud boom that rattled all the windows, and when I went outside to try to identify what had happened—did a tree fall down? was there a car crash? was that an earthquake?—I found all my neighbors outside doing the same thing and asking the same questions, and we were all on our phones, collaborating to try and satisfy our curiosity, Googling and texting geologist friends and checking Twitter. (This was back when Twitter was useful.) It turned out to have been a sonic boom caused by fighter jets flying overhead. But my point is that it’s a human instinct to categorize timbres based on their source sounds. 

So given the primacy of this urge, sound-source identification seems like an appropriate skill to develop in aural skills classes and in theory fundamentals classes, and it would be a component of other discussions in higher-level coursework too. Activities could begin with simpler tasks, like distinguishing orchestral instruments from one another, but proceed to more subtle differences: telling a viola from a violin or cello, learning what different effects pedals do to an electric guitar sound, or identifying various auxiliary percussion instruments. I think this is one of the more straightforward conceptions of timbre with the clearest kinds of assessments, so this won’t be a focus for me today either, but sound-source identification is also an assumed skill for some of the activities I’ll discuss later in this talk.

## Semantics

-   Great for written theory classes
-   Theory already spends a lot of time establishing vocabulary; this is a natural fit

<aside class='notes'>
The most natural fit for a traditional music theory curriculum is the study of timbre semantics. Learning specialized terms and how to apply them is already a large portion of what we do in theory class. One might object that timbre terminology is too variable to codify and teach, but other aspects of music theory are the same way—terms for form in pop music, chord symbols, even approaches to set theory—and yet we make decisions as teachers and commit to them in our classrooms. I will spend some time soon discussing what this might look like in classroom activities or homework assignments.

## Polyphonic Timbre

-   Analysis of texture: more than just "monophonic, polyphonic, homophonic"
-   Auditory stream analysis (ASA)

[McAdams, Goodchild, and Soden, “A Taxonomy of Orchestral Grouping Effects Derived from Principles of Auditory Perception” (2022)](https://www.zotero.org/mlavengood/collections/TJALUVK7/item-list)

<!-- .element: style="font-size: medium;"-->

<aside class='notes'>
McAdams and his coauthors call polyphonic timbre “one of the most complex, mysterious, and dazzling aspects of music.” I agree, and I think that polyphonic timbre has some of the greatest power to pique our students’ curiosity about timbre. 

A prerequisite to the study of polyphonic timbre is the study of texture and what’s called “auditory scene analysis,” both of which involve grouping instruments in a larger ensemble into component “streams” of aural information. Research has shown that treating ensemble timbre as a unified entity (for example, by analyzing a spectrogram from a mixed and mastered mono or stereo recording of an orchestral work) does not adequately reflect human experience of that ensemble performance, because listeners do not in fact experience this as a unified timbre, but rather as coordinated but separate timbres. This necessitates defining those smaller streams that a listener would attend to and evaluate separately. To be clear: analysis of texture is not the same as analysis of timbre, but the two are intertwined in this way—by analyzing texture, we can determine what entities constitute a single “timbre” in a given context.

With these grounding principles in mind, I’ll move now to the portion of my talk where I present some practical classroom resources, activities, and assessment structures that could begin to facilitate the inclusion of timbre analysis in our courses.

## Textbooks and readings <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Traditional textbooks don't help much:

<div class="container" style="font-size: xx-large;">

::: .col-8

-   **One (or one-half) chapter** on texture/timbre
    -   Benward/Saker<br>(“Texture and textural reduction”)
    -   Laitz<br>(“Triads, Seventh Chords, and Texture”)
    -   Roig-Francoli<br>(“The Rudiments of Harmony II: Labeling Chords. Musical Texture.”)
::: 
::: .col

- **No chapters on texture/timbre**

</div>

<p class="fragment fade-up" style="font-size:larger;font-weight:bold">But Open Educational Resources (OER) do!</p>

<aside class='notes'>
Textbooks have a huge impact on curricula. While many of us who are professional, employed, full-time music theorists may feel comfortable developing our own materials based on scholarship we’ve read, many of us also work with people who need to rely on published or otherwise pre-existing material to teach their courses—for example, adjuncts who are not paid adequately and/or non-theorists often teach theory and aural skills classes. And the conventional textbooks focus on pitch and form. Of the seven common textbooks that make up 96% of the market share, only three include include a single chapter on texture, and two of them are still kind of about pitch, apparently (I didn’t actually look at the chapters). So the first thing I want to do is provide everyone with some excellent open educational resources (OER) that I’ve found that can support what I’m discussing today. Because they are free to access and use, you don’t have to drop your current curriculum wholesale to adopt these—they can augment your current text or curriculum without adding to your students’ costs.

The ACTOR Network, a cadre of researchers mainly from McGill, has a Timbre and Orchestration Resource that they describe as “an open-access web platform supporting the analysis, creation and teaching of timbre and orchestration.” Here, they’ve set up extensive modules for teaching timbre that include learning objectives, a reading list, and ideas for assignments. There are also syllabi for entire courses focused on timbre. While this resource is maybe less plug-and-play at the undergraduate level than Open Music Theory or Foundations of Aural Skills, I’ve found it excellent for preparing my graduate seminars in timbre analysis, and it could probably work well in an upper-level undergraduate elective too.

I’m now writing chapters on auditory scene analysis and timbre vocabulary, which I hope to have up before next Fall semester.

## Activities and Assessments <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

-   Music theory loves visuals: annotated scores, form charts, musical geometries, dot grids/coffee-bean grids
-   How to visually represent and assess timbre analyses?

<aside class='notes'>
One difficulty in teaching timbre that I haven’t yet explicitly mentioned is the problem of assessment. Music theory assessments typically occur in a written format. Some music theorists—including myself, in this very talk—use  the term “written music theory” to clarify that we are not talking about aural skills classes. Homework is typically a worksheet or pages from a workbook; we collect musical compositions, annotated scores, form charts, and the like.

## Polyphonic Timbre: Functional Layers <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

-   Layer graphs show entrance and exit of different layers of a musical work
-   E.g.: Butler (2006, background), Dolan (2013), Lavengood (2021)
-   Probably created with Excel or programming toolkits for data science

</div>

<aside class='notes'>
Analysts of timbre and texture have often created layer graphs that show the entrances and exits of a piece’s constituent instruments with the goal of illustrating the textural organization of a piece of music. Such graphs would be a good analogue for more familiar music-theoretical artifacts, like part-writing homework or form charts. Unfortunately, while dedicated music scholars may be able to craft these visual aids themselves, the average undergraduate music major likely does not have the time, the patience, and/or the software fluency to create a chart like this by formatting cells in Microsoft Excel or using a Python script to generate a Gantt chart (these are two methods I have used myself in the past). 

To help address this issue, I am working with Brian Jarvis (a music theorist and capable Javascript programmer) and Evan Williams (a data scientist) to create a web app that would allow anyone to create a layer graph with relative ease.
