* Music theory as an area of research has become much more broad and inclusive.
* But without resources, it's difficult to reflect this in the classrom.

---

## Common critiques of theory and aural skills <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

1.	Theory classes should discuss more than just classical music. 
2.	Theory classes spend too much time on form and (especially) pitch.
3.	Theory classes alienate our students, and function as weeder classes that are gatekeeping certain people from studying music in an academic setting, to the detriment of our departments and our field.

Some published critique of typical undergraduate theory curriculum (look in [bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/mlavengood/collections/TJALUVK7/item-list) for more info)

### Motivations

* Practical concerns about enrollment dips and budget
* Ethical concerns about imperialism and exclusion

### What can we do?

* Appropriately circumscribe our work and recognize our positionality
* Learn how to look at music in new and more holistic ways

## Talk outline

1. Define timbre’s multifaceted nature
2. Suggest how different facets of timbre analysis would fit into different parts of an undergraduate music major curriculum
3. Offer practical resources for incorporating timbre study into your own curricula, based on my own experience and expertise

---

## Five "Conceptions" of timbre <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

1. Timbre as sound-source identifcation
2. Acoustics of timbre
3. Perceived timbre
4. Timbre semantics
5. Polyphonic timbre

[Stephen McAdams, “‘What Is Timbre?’ vs. ‘What Can We Do with Timbre?’: Picking the Right Questions” (2018)](https://www.zotero.org/mlavengood/collections/TJALUVK7/item-list) <!-- .element: style="font-size: large;"-->

--

## Perceived timbre

* Music perception and cognition
* Cultural musicology

Both require particular modes of research and thinking that are not typically engaged in theory classes

--

## Acoustics

* Research uses software and hardware that may be inaccessible or difficult for many undergraduate students
* Better suited to music technology class

--

## Sound-source identification

* Great for fundamentals and aural skills; important basis for later work too
* Activity: identifying instruments by ear, with increasing precision and nuance

--

## Semantics

* Great for written theory classes
* Theory already spends a lot of time establishing vocabulary; this is a natural fit

--

## Polyphonic Timbre

* Analysis of texture
* Auditory stream analysis (ASA)

[McAdams, Goodchild, and Soden, “A Taxonomy of Orchestral Grouping Effects Derived from Principles of Auditory Perception” (2022)](https://www.zotero.org/mlavengood/collections/TJALUVK7/item-list) <!-- .element: style="font-size: medium;"-->

## Classroom resources <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Traditional textbooks don't help much:

<div class="container" style="font-size: xx-large;">
<div class="col-8">

* **One (or one-half) chapter** on texture/timbre
	* Benward/Saker<br>(“Texture and textural reduction”)
	* Laitz<br>(“Triads, Seventh Chords, and Texture”)
	* Roig-Francoli<br>(“The Rudiments of Harmony II: Labeling Chords. Musical Texture.”)

</div>
<div class="col">

* **No chapters on texture/timbre**
	* Clendinning/Marvin
	* Aldwell/Schachter
	* Burstein/Straus
	* Kostka/Payne/Almèn
</div>
</div>

<p class="fragment fade-up" style="font-size:larger;font-weight:bold;">But Open Educational Resources (OER) do!</p>
